# Knowledge File Bootstrap

I need to create a [knowledge file](~/.cursor/skills/context-engineering/refs/knowledge-files.md) for [TECHNOLOGY].

1. Document the key relationships, patterns, and concepts we use
2. Include working code examples for our specific use cases
3. Note common pitfalls and how to avoid them
4. Flag any areas where AI assistants typically hallucinate

Save to docs/knowledge/[technology-name].md

Keep under 50KB. Split into multiple files by subtopic if larger.
