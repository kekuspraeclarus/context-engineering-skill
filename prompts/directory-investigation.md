# Directory Investigation

Analyse the architecture of [DIRECTORY] and its subdirectories:

1. Identify design patterns, key abstractions, and interfaces
2. Give a brief overview of what this section of the code does
3. Document dependencies and their purposes
4. Note naming conventions and code organisation
5. Flag any gotchas or non-obvious behaviours

Create or update a ./docs/architecture/ file capturing this knowledge.
Include the module's purpose, architectural decisions, and common patterns.
If unsure of something, ask me rather than make assumptions
