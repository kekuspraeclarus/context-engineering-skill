# Feature Context Setup

I'm about to implement [FEATURE NAME].

1. Create docs/requirements/[feature-name].prd.md following the [template](~/.cursor/skills/context-engineering/templates/feature.md)

2. Update ./docs/ files if this feature introduces new patterns or architectural decisions.

Ask me if you need me to clarify anything
